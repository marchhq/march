## About
march is a notion alternative for getting things done‚Äîthe tool we wished existed, so we're building it ourselves. We've tried Notion, Obsidian, Anytype, Todoist, etc., but none of them felt quite right. Those are great apps, and if they work for you, we're not saying March will be better. But here‚Äôs what makes March different:

- **Connected Workflow:** March integrates with all your favorite tools and automatically collects action items into a universal inbox.
- **Simple Object-Based System:** Everything‚Äîmeetings, bookmarks, Linear issues‚Äîis treated as an object with a type. You can customize views based on object types.
- **Dynamic Interface:** Build your own productivity page/ space with blocks, you decide how your action items should look like.
- **Smart Organization:** No tedious templates‚ÄîMarch organizes your data dynamically based on behavior and object types.
- **AI-Powered Productivity:** Plan your day, perform actions in connected apps, and stay accountable. march pushes you to get things done‚Äîor take breaks when needed.

March is currently **free and open source**, maintained by **[@oliursahin](https://github.com/oliursahin)** and **[@sajdakabir](https://github.com/sajdakabir)**. If you love using it, consider [buying us a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/oliursahin)‚Äîit helps us keep the servers running.

> **Alpha Notice:** march is still in an alpha stage and is only suitable for enthusiastic testers willing to endure bugs and an incomplete app. However, it's our daily driver, and we are actively developing it.
